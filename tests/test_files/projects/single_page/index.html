      <b>About Us</b>
      <p>Splash Mountain is a re-telling of the classic Disney movie, “Song of the South.” Song of the South features the character Uncle Remus and his stories of hope and bravery to young children in the South. 
        Told through the journey of the movie’s hero, Brer Rabbit, the adventure is about using clever thinking and wit to avoid difficult issues. 
        In Brer Rabbit’s case, that means to avoid being eaten by Brer Fox and Brer Bear. Just when he is about to be eaten by Brer Fox, Brer Rabbit has an idea about his childhood home and laughin’ place, the briar patch! 
        Come along as we experience an amazing adventure with the critters of Splash Mountain. Happiness is a decision that you make… Having a bright outlook on life can create positive opportunities. 
        Zip A Dee Do Dah, is still a popular song, made famous from Song of the South. Brer Rabbit certainly found reasons to be happy. The song Zip A Dee Do Dah was awarded an Academy Award in 1945 for the best movie song. While there is always a reason to be sad, there is certainly always a reason to be happy! “Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay my, oh my, what a wonderful day, plenty of sunshine headin' my way”… are some of the lyrics of the song that have placed the words in the American lexicon to mean that there is a positive outlook and a great way to live life. 
        See if you can find all of fun references to find happiness on Splash Mountain!
