    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I was born a young child in Phoenix, Arizona. I was the last of five children, but I had a good childhood.</p>
    <p>My favorite memories were of <strong>bicycling</strong>, <em>exploring the ditch</em> near my house, and
        <em>making movies</em> with our 8mm camera.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I love to play <strong>guitar</strong> and code. I have both an electric and acoustic guitar, but I prefer my
        acoustic.</p>
