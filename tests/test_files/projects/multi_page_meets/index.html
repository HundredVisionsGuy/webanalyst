        <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Heh-haa! <strong> Super squeaky bum time!</strong> <em> You've swallowed a planet!</em> You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>
        <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
        <p>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>

        <li>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</li>

        <p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
        <p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>

        <li>You hit me with a cricket bat.</li>
        <li>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
