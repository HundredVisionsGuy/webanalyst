        <p>In 2017, <b>BTS</b> began their <i>Love Yourself</i> series, which comprised of three albums (<i>Love Yourself: Her</i>, <i>Love Yourself: Tear</i>, & <i>Love Yourself: Answer</i>) and one video (<i>Love Yourself: Wonder</i>).

            <li>Painful love</li>
            <li>Self-love</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The aim of the series was to tell a story about finding and exploring true love, which was realized to be <b>self-love</b>.</p>
        <p class="bold">The message was to love yourself because accepting your worth and flaws will help you love others. When you can love yourself, you can give that same love to others.</p>
        <p>On November 1, 2017, <b>BTS</b> and <b>Big Hit Music</b> partnered with <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund)</a> in their <a href="https://www.end-violence.org/">#ENDviolence</a> campaign in order to spread the message of self-love. <b>#ENDviolence's objective was to eradicate violence against children and teens by providing them safety.</b> It was created to promote protection for young people and devise solutions to end violence.</p>
        <p>Thus, the group and their label created the <a href="https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/">LOVE MYSELF</a> campaign in partnership with <b>UNICEF</b>. <b>LOVE MYSELF</b> promoted self-love for young children globally. <b>With love, the world can become a better place to live in.</b></p>
        <p>To raise awareness, <b>BTS</b> promoted the cause on social media. At some concerts, <b>UNICEF</b> and <b>LOVE MYSELF</b> booths were set up to teach fans about the cause's message. Fans have contributed to the cause by</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Donating money</li>
            <li>Spreading awareness with <b>#BTSLoveMyself</b></li>
            <li>Sharing their personal self-love journeys</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>BTS</b> and <b>Big Hit Music</b> pledged to donate <b>3%</b> of the <i>Love Yourself</i> album series and <b>all</b> the proceeds made from the campaign's merchandise. Donations are made towards programs <b>supporting and protecting</b> children and teens from:</p>

        <li>Domestic violence</li>
        <li>School violence</li>
        <li>Sexual violence</li>
