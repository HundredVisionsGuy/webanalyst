<p>Splash Mountain is a re-telling of the classic Disney movie, “Song of the South.” Song of the South features the character Uncle Remus and his stories of hope and bravery to young children in the South. Told through the journey of the movie’s hero, Brer Rabbit, the adventure is about using clever thinking and wit to avoid difficult issues. In Brer Rabbit’s case, that means to avoid being eaten by Brer Fox and Brer Bear. Just when he is about to be eaten by Brer Fox, Brer Rabbit has an idea about his childhood home and laughin’ place, the briar patch!  Come along as we experience an amazing adventure with the critters of Splash Mountain. Happiness is a decision that you make… Having a bright outlook on life can create positive opportunities. Zip A Dee Do Dah, is still a popular song, made famous from Song of the South. Brer Rabbit certainly found reasons to be happy. The song Zip A Dee Do Dah was awarded an Academy Award in 1945 for the best movie song. While there is always a reason to be sad, there is certainly always a reason to be happy!  “Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay my, oh my, what a wonderful day, plenty of sunshine headin' my way”… are some of the lyrics of the song that have placed the words in the American lexicon to mean that there is a positive outlook and a great way to live life. See if you can find all of fun references to find happiness on Splash Mountain! </p>

<p>By the time Disneyland officially opened on July 17, 1955, the final price tag was $17 million. Twenty years later, the construction of the Space Mountain complex cost $18 million, including an arcade and a permanent amphitheater.Though the darkness, the projections of the galaxy, and several sudden drops make the roller coaster seem like you're careening wildly through space, the rockets only reach a top speed of 28 miles per hour. By comparison, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad can get up to 30 miles per hour, and the Splash Mountain descent can reach 40. The only thrill ride that goes slower is the 25-mph Barnstormer, a coaster intended for smaller children. Space Mountain's grand debut at the Magic Kingdom was quite the affair, including NASA astronauts and Disney astronauts (Mickey and friends wearing spiffy new space suits), along with a 2000-piece marching band that the music director had just four hours to organize. When the ride launched at Disneyland two years later, U.S. Mercury Astronauts Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, Donald “Deke” Slayton and Betty Grissom (widow of Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom) were all there to experience space from Earth.</p>

<p>Test Track is located at Epcot Center, a part of Disney World. When you walk into the Epcot property, there is one important thing you have to do before going on the ride. First, you have to create the car you will ride in. I know that sounds a little weird, but you head into the design lab, a room where there are little desks that have screens on them. The screens are programmed to help you create the car that you want. To make Test Track, Diego and other imagineers came together with Chevy designers and told the story of how you design a car. They started with a base and then added different options and ideas for you. They want you to experience what it is like to design a car for Chevy and then be able to ride it in real life. The only improvement I would add would be able to add a couple of different attributes from the design lab to the actual ride, such as the exterior orange graphic flames that I created on the car I created. The car on the Test Track is straight-up blue.</p>
