        <p>A figure-eight loop around Takhlakh Lake and past Takh Takh Meadow, ascending up a lava flow for fantastic vistas of Mount Rainier, the Goat Rocks, and Mount Adams. You can also do a lake-only loop is also possible for a much shorter and leveler hike.
            The hike starts from the day use area at Takhlakh Lake Campground, but it can also be started from TakhTakh Meadow along FR-2329 or any other road crossing on the TakhTakh Meadow Trail.
            
            </p>
            <p>The South Climb Trail #183 begins at a signboard and wilderness permit sign-in station. Past the station, 
                the Forest Service has cut down all the trees killed by the 2012 Cascade Creek Fire. 
                You'll move in and out of burned patches of mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, and lodgepole pine forest as you ascend. 
                The wide tread switchbacks four times and curves gradually up an old road track. Whitebark pines join the mix of conifers. 
                You'll pass the site of the old Timberline Campground on the right and soon reach the Round-the-Mountain-South Climb Trail  Junction.</p>
