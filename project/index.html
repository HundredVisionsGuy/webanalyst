    <h1>My Life</h1>
       <p>I was born in a town when my dad was in the army. I moved to some place when I was very young I cant remeber how old I was. I went to school in that state from one to another grade. I moved to a state I think some years ago. I went to school from one grade to another grade. I moved alot when I was younger so I went to many schools when I was in that state.</p>
